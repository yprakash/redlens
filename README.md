# RedLens — LLM Red-Team Kit

**RedLens** is a continuous, experimental toolkit and living codebase for building defensive, auditable, and reproducible countermeasures against adversarial attacks on large language models.  
It is designed for engineers and teams who build, deploy, or secure AI systems and who want a practical, hands-on lab for adversarial thinking, mitigations engineering, and measurable hardening patterns — all runnable locally or on private model runtimes.

## Why RedLens Matters

Modern LLM applications surface new classes of risks: prompt/jailbreak attacks, poisoned retrieval context, coerced function calls, and subtle exfiltration channels.  
RedLens treats these problems as **engineering challenges** — requiring repeatable experiments, auditable mitigations, and human-centered controls — not just theoretical descriptions.

This project is intentionally **defensive-first**: every experiment focuses on *how to detect*, *how to harden*, and *how to fail safely* when adversarial inputs occur.  
It serves as a testbed for continuous improvement of production safeguards, internal security playbooks, and incident response workflows.

## Value Proposition (For Engineering / Security Leaders)

- **Practical Defensive PoCs** — Reproducible, code-driven examples showing realistic (synthetic) attack vectors and robust mitigations you can adapt to production.
- **Local-First, Auditable** — Runs on mocked or local model adapters so experiments are offline, reproducible, and privacy-preserving.
- **Human-in-the-Loop by Design** — Every high-risk flow includes explicit gating, provenance metadata, and audit logging for operational control and compliance.
- **Threat-Model Centric** — Each experiment is guided by a concrete threat model with measurable test cases and clear mitigations.
- **Engineering-Grade Artifacts** — Unit tests, CI pipelines, schema validation, and incident runbooks designed for integration into DevSecOps workflows.

## Core Capabilities

- **Jailbreak Scanner** — Rule + semantic detectors for known jailbreak and prompt-injection tactic classes, with confidence scoring and human review escalation.
- **RAG Poisoning Simulator** — In-memory retrieval experiments demonstrating context contamination, provenance tracking, and sanitization before LLM inference.
- **Function-Call Fuzzer & Validator** — Simulates model-suggested function calls, enforcing allowlist and typed schemas (via Pydantic) to block unsafe actions.
- **Audit & Runbook Tools** — Structured logging, incident traces, and reproducible runbooks for operationalizing findings.
- **Mockable Model Adapter** — Unified interface supporting both `mock` and `local` modes to ensure deterministic, offline experimentation.

## Technical Approach

1. **Layered Defenses** — Combine lightweight static rules, semantic checks, and schema validations; never rely on a single detection mechanism.  
2. **Minimal, Testable Components** — Each mitigation is implemented as a small, auditable function with clear unit tests and defined failure modes.  
3. **Provenance & Transparency** — Retrievals and sanitization steps are tagged with metadata and logged for traceability.  
4. **Fail-Safe Defaults** — Ambiguous or high-risk inputs automatically escalate to human review instead of executing.  
5. **Local & Open** — Uses open-source, local runtimes and mocks; no paid APIs or cloud dependencies required.

## Ethics & Operational Guardrails

RedLens is explicitly **defensive** and governed by strict ethical constraints:

- All demonstrations use **synthetic data** and run only on **local or mocked** models.  
- No external targets or live systems are ever used without **explicit written permission**.  
- High-risk flows are **disabled by default** and require explicit enablement flags.  
- Sanitization and redaction steps are **logged with metadata** for full auditability.  
- `SECURITY.md` and `ETHICS.md` define **responsible disclosure** and safe experimentation guidelines.

## How Teams Can Use RedLens

- Run the included mock demos to benchmark your system’s defenses against controlled adversarial prompts.  
- Integrate the **Function-Call Validator** to enforce strict schema validation in your LLM pipelines.  
- Use the **RAG Sanitizer** to scrub and annotate retrieved documents before feeding them to the model.  
- Extend the **Scanner** with your own detection rules and measure performance under different configurations.  
- Embed RedLens unit tests into your CI to detect regressions in prompt or retrieval hardening.

## Built for Continuous Experimentation

RedLens is a **living project** — designed for continuous evolution.  
Add new attack patterns, measure mitigation effectiveness, and track resilience improvements over time.  
The goal is not a static demo, but a **repeatable engineering practice**:  
**label → simulate → harden → measure → repeat.**

## Quick Start (Local / Mock Mode)

1. Clone the repository.  
2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment.  
3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the mock demo scripts to observe vulnerable vs. hardened behaviors:
   ```bash
   python -m redlens.scanner.demo
   python -m redlens.rag_poisoning.demo
   python -m redlens.function_fuzz.demo
   ```
5. Review `ETHICS.md` and `SECURITY.md` before extending any components.

## Contact & Governance
For maintainers, coordination, or responsible disclosure, refer to:
- `SECURITY.md` — for vulnerability reporting.
- `ETHICS.md` — for research boundaries and disclosure principles.

**RedLens** exists to bridge the gap between **AI research** and **defensive engineering** —
turning adversarial risks into measurable, testable, and improvable system safeguards.
